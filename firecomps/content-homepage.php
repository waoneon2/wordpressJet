            <p>The Campus Freedom Network (CFN) is a loosely-knit coalition of faculty members and students dedicated to advancing individual liberties on their campuses. Its goal is to encourage energetic students and faculty members to pressure their administrations to change illiberal and unconstitutional policies. By organizing students and faculty, the CFN strives to change the culture of censorship on college campuses from the inside.</p>
