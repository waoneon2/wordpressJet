### How to Import CSV

The importer on ```Tools > Importers``` then you can click ```Jetty Inquiry Importer```.
If the csv file you want to import on your computer, you can click ```Choose a File```, but if the
file already on server, you can enter it on ```enter path to file``` field.

Most CSV field is using comma ```,``` as delimiter, that's why the importer assume this by default.
